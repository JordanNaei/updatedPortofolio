# Updated Portofolio

This project aimed to enhace our portofolio page by adding some extra functionalities to showcase our coding work so far. We added a Showcase page to our website that can be accessed using the navbar. Further, we liked github profile, resume within the footer icons, also added titles to the phone and email icons to list the required information.

   - Link to the deployed version (pass)

## We leveraged the following technology and resources in our implementation:

- Bootstrap framework: especially within the creation of the Navbar and footer .
- Bootstrap grid system, to ensure that the layout is standarized and responsive to variety of screen sizes.
- Ensured that the website meets the general standards of:
  1- Accessibility.
  2- Performance.
  3- HTML best practices.
  5- SEO.
  Please refer to the word document attached for the Inspect generated report.
- Used W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure html best practices are applied.
- Used Media Queries to takecare of the display in case of shrinking and expanding the browser window to different unstanderized widths.
