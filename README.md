# Jordan Naei "About Me" Project

This project aim to provide a full website with three major pages:

1- About Me Page: In this page we provided Bio, hoppies, and highlights of the Individual.
2- Portfolio Page: In this page we listed some cool picture associated to the areas of interest of the Individual.
3- Contact Me page: In this page we provided a contact me forum to provide the user with the ability to contact the Individual.

## We leveraged the following technology and resources in our implementation:
* Bootstrap framework: especially within the creation of the Navbar and footer .
* Bootstrap grid system, to ensure that the layout is standarized and responsive to variety of screen sizes.
* Ensured that the website meets the general standards of:
            1- Accessibility.
            2- Performance. 
            3- HTML best practices.
            5- SEO.
